						<p class="missionstl stl1">Back in May of 2015, Carlos visited a school in South City. He was greeted by several students and one by the name of Isaac (entering 5th grade). Carlos was touched to say the least. It was a pretty exciting day for the students. Not only did Carlos give an inspiring speech, but he also took the time to play with them during gym class.</p>
						<p class="missionstl">A month later, at Carlos’ fundraising event at the Flamingo Bowl on Washington ave, Carlos invited Isaac and his family to come bowl. Little did they know, with the help of Principal “K”, Carlos had a surprise for Isaac and his younger brother Abraham.</p>

						<p>Remembering where he came from is a huge part of Carlos Martinez’s success. He always told himself when he made it to the big leagues that he would not forget to pay if forward. Hence his passion to return to his hometown, Puerto Plata, every year and give to so many underprivileged children.</p>
						<p><em>"I personally have a second mission, and that is to give back to underprivileged kids. As you already may know, I was that kid with no glove and no spikes, but I had dreams of one day playing in the big leagues. Now that I’m capable of giving back, I’m totally involved in this cause. With my foundation, Tsunami Waves, I donate equipment on a yearly basis to underprivileged kids in my home town Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic."</em></p>
